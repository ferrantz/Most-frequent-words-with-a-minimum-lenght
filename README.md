# Most-frequent-words-with-a-minimum-lenght
This is a simple way to retrieve the most frequent words with a determined lenght and to plot them with Python.
I used only two libraries and, to testing, I used the text of "Rosso Malpelo". 
I tend to make it clear that this is a way to do this word with a "cleaned" .txt file. If you want to do this work with the text of an Internet page, you must do a preliminary work (using for instance libraries like nltk.
For any problems, feel free to contact me. 
You can utilize this code for any use.
